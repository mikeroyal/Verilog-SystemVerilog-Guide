  Verilog/SystemVerilog Guide
</h1>

#### A guide covering Verilog & SystemVerilog including the applications, libraries and tools that will make you a better and more efficient developer with Verilog & SystemVerilog and have a better understanding of how hardware works on the lowest level.

## Resources

[Verilog](https://verilog.com/) is a Hardware Description Language(HDL) used to design and document electronic systems. Verilog HDL allows designers to design at various levels of abstraction.

[SystemVerilog](https://www.systemverilog.io/) is an extension of Verilog with many of the verification features that allow engineers to verifythe design using complex testbench structures and random stimuli in simulation.

## Tools

[Apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) is a multiplatform toolbox, with static pre-built packages, project configuration tools and easy command interface to verify, synthesize, simulate and upload your verilog designs.

[IceStorm](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm) is a project that aims at documenting the bitstream format of Lattice iCE40 FPGAs and providing simple tools for analyzing and creating bitstream files.

[Icestudio](https://icestudio.io/) is a visual editor for open FPGA boards. Built on top of the Icestorm project using Apio.

[EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com) is a online code for programming your Verilog projects.

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is a professional collaborative platform for embedded development with no vendor lock-in. It provides support for multiplatforms and frameworks such as IoT, Arduino, CMSIS, ESP-IDF, FreeRTOS, libOpenCM3, mbed OS, Pulp OS, SPL, STM32Cube, Zephyr RTOS, ARM, AVR, Espressif (ESP8266/ESP32), FPGA, MCS-51 (8051), MSP430, Nordic (nRF51/nRF52), NXP i.MX RT, PIC32, RISC-V.

[PlatformIO for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide) is a plugin that provides support for the PlatformIO IDE on VSCode.

[Chisel](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) is a hardware design language that facilitates advanced circuit generation and design reuse for both ASIC and FPGA digital logic designs. Chisel adds hardware construction primitives to the [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) programming language, providing designers with the power of a modern programming language to write complex, parameterizable circuit generators that produce synthesizable Verilog.

[Clash compiler](https://www.clash-lang.org/) is a functional hardware description language that borrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language Haskell. The Clash compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to low-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.

[Verilator](https://verilator.org/) is an open-source SystemVerilog simulator and lint system.

[Verilog to Routing(VTR)](https://verilogtorouting.org/) is a collaborative project to provide a open-source framework for conducting FPGA architecture and CAD Research & Development. The VTR design flow takes as input a Verilog description of a digital circuit, and a description of the target FPGA architecture.

[Cascade](https://github.com/vmware/cascade) is a Just-In-Time Compiler for Verilog from VMware Research. Cascade executes code immediately in a software simulator, and performs compilation in the background. When compilation is finished, the code is moved into hardware, and from the user’s perspective it simply gets faster over time.

[OpenTimer](https://github.com/OpenTimer/OpenTimer) is a High-Performance Timing Analysis Tool for VLSI Systems.
